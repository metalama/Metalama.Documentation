# Metalama Patterns

Metalama Patterns, housed under the <xref:patterns-api?text=Metalama.Patterns> namespace, consist of libraries of aspects that implement the most common design patterns for C#.

Constructed by the Metalama team, these patterns uphold the same quality standard as the Metalama framework itself.

The following libraries are currently available:

| Library | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <xref:contract-patterns> | Metalama Contracts implement Contract-Based Programming via preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. This aids in building maintainable, reliable, and scalable software systems. |
| <xref:caching> | Metalama Caching combines object-oriented and aspect-oriented APIs.
| <xref:memoization> | A simple and high-performance alternative to caching limited to get-only properties and paramerless methods. |
| <xref:dependency-injection-aspect> | An aspect to automatically pull dependencies from fields and properties. Supports lazy loading. |
