# Metalama Patterns

Metalama Patterns, housed under the <xref:patterns-api?text=Metalama.Patterns> namespace, consist of libraries of aspects that implement the most common design patterns for C#.

Constructed by the Metalama team, these patterns uphold the same quality standard as the Metalama framework itself. They are released under the open-source MIT license and are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/postsharp/Metalama.Patterns).

The following libraries are currently available:

| Library | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <xref:contract-patterns> | Metalama Contracts implement Contract-Based Programming via preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. This aids in building maintainable, reliable, and scalable software systems. |
