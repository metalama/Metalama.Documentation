# Getting started with Metalama Caching

If you have a time-consuming method that consistently returns the same value when called with identical arguments, caching this method can significantly enhance your application's performance. With Metalama Caching, this process can be as straightforward as adding the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheAttribute?text=[Cache]> attribute from the [Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects/) package.

Before you can utilize the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheAttribute?text=[Cache]> aspect, your projects require some setup. The approach will depend on your project's architecture: with or without dependency injection.

> [!WARNING]
> The fallback strategy to generate the cache key of a parameter is to use the `ToString` method. However, the default implementation of the `ToString` method does not return a unique string for custom classes and structs (the default implementation of `ToString` for records is more likely to be correct). After completing the initial steps of this _getting started_ guide, it is crucial to provide a cache key implementation for all parameter types of a cached method. For details, see <xref:caching-keys>.

## With dependency injection

If your project is designed for the .NET Core dependency injection framework (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`), follow these steps:

1. Add the [Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects/) package into your project.
2. In your application setup logic, while adding services to the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection>, include a call to the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Building.CachingServiceFactory.AddCaching*> extension method. This action will add an instance of the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.ICachingService> interface, which is consumed by the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheAttribute?text=[Cache]> aspect.

    [!metalama-file ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.Caching/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.Program.cs mark="Registration"]

The <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheAttribute?text=[Cache]> aspect is now available to all objects instantiated by the dependency injection container.

> [!NOTE]
> If your project uses a different dependency injection framework, you may need to create an adapter for this framework. Then create an instance of the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.ICachingService> interface using the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.CachingService.Create*?text=CachingService.Create> method.  For details about DI adapters, see <xref:dependency-injection>.

### Example: setting up caching _with_ dependency injection

In this example, we demonstrate how to add logging to a self-hosted .NET Core application. This application consists of two services, the primary service called `MainService` and a hypothetical `CloudCalculator`, which performs complex and slow computations.

`Program.Main` calls the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Building.CachingServiceFactory.AddCaching*> extension method. This action makes <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.ICachingService> available to `CloudCalculator`, which can use the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheAttribute?text=[Cache]> aspect. Note how the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.ICachingService> interface is automatically pulled into the `CloudCalculator` class.

Finally, `MainService` calls `CloudCalculator` as usual. It calls the `CloudCalculator.Add` three times with the same parameters and displays the actual number of operations performed at the end.

## Without dependency injection

If your project does not use dependency injection, the global default instance of the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.ICachingService> will be used. It is exposed as the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.CachingService.Default?text=CachingService.Default> property.

Follow these steps to configure your project:

1. Add the [Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects/) package into your project.
2. Create a file named, for instance, `CachingConfiguration.cs`, and add the following code:

    [!metalama-test ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.Caching/GettingStarted_NoDI/GettingStarted_NoDI.CachingConfiguration.cs ]

    This code disables dependency injection for the whole project. You can also add this attribute to individual types to disable dependency injection specifically for these types. You can also configure your project using fabrics and use the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.Configuration.CachingConfigurationExtensions.ConfigureCaching*?text=amender.Outgoing.ConfigureCaching> method and modify the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.Configuration.CachingOptionsBuilder.UseDependencyInjection> property for selected namespaces or types.

3. Initialize the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.CachingService.Default?text=CachingService.Default> property from your initialization code (typically `Program.Main`). Call the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.CachingService.Create*?text=CachingService.Create> method to get a new instance of the service.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The caching service must be initialized before any cached method is called for the first time.


When dependency injection is disabled, we can also cache `static` methods. Observe the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheAttribute?text=[Cache]> in the static `CloudCalculator` implementation.

## What's next

So far, so good. However, if your cached methods have more complex parameters than intrinsic types like `int` or `string` (and a dozen of other well-known types), Metalama Caching will use the `ToString` method to represent the parameter in the caching key. This approach may not always be appropriate. In the next article, we will discuss how to customize the caching key.
