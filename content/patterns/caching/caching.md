# Metalama.Patterns.Caching

Caching is an effective method to enhance the performance of an application. Traditionally, implementing caching requires interacting with the API of the caching framework (such as <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.MemoryCache>) or database (like Redis). It also involves incorporating moderately complex logic into your source code to generate the cache key, verify the item's existence in the cache, and add the item to the cache. Additional complexity arises from the necessity to remove items from the cache when the source data is updated. Manual caching implementation is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, as it is easy to generate inconsistent cache keys between read and update methods.

## Benefits

Metalama Caching offers several advantages over manual caching:

* **Reduced boilerplate**: Metalama Caching enables you to cache the return value of a method as a function of its arguments with just a custom attribute, specifically the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheAttribute?text=[Cache]> aspect. To invalidate the cache, add the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.InvalidateCacheAttribute?text=[InvalidateCache]> aspect to the update methods. To use a custom class as a parameter of a cached method, apply the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching.Aspects.CacheKeyAttribute?text=[CacheKey]> aspect to mark the properties that uniquely identify the object. Consequently, your business code becomes shorter and more readable.

* **Reduced bugs**: Manually generating cache keys with hand-written code is notorious for being bug-prone. Metalama Caching eliminates this source of defects by implementing a reliable approach to key generation, combining object-oriented and aspect-oriented techniques.

* **Reduced coupling**: Cache invalidation can be complex and often requires you to review your complete _write_ methods every time you add caching to a _read_ method. Cache dependencies act as an abstraction layer between _read_ and _write_ methods, reducing coupling between them.

* **Flexible topologies**: Metalama Caching supports several caching topologies, allowing you to switch between them effortlessly:

    * In-memory caching,
    * Redis-based distributed caching (see <xref:caching-redis>),
    * Redis-based distributed caching with a synchronized in-memory L1 (see <xref:caching-redis>), and
    * In-memory caching with multi-node synchronization over Azure Service Bus or Redis Pub/Sub  (see <xref:caching-pubsub>).
