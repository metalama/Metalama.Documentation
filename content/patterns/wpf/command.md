# WPF Command

In WPF, a command is an object that implements the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand> interface, which can be bound to UI controls such as buttons to trigger actions and can enable or disable these controls based on the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.CanExecute*> method. The <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.Execute*> method runs the command, while the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.CanExecuteChanged> event notifies when the command's availability changes.

Implementing WPF commands manually typically requires much boilerplate code, especially to support the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.CanExecuteChanged> event.

The <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute?text=[Command]> aspect generates most of the WPF command boilerplate automatically. When applied to a method, the aspect generates a Command property. It can also bind to a `CanExecute` property or method and integrates with <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged>.

## Generating a WPF command property from a method

To generate a WPF command property from a method:

1. Add a reference to the `Metalama.Patterns.Wpf` package to your project.
2. Add the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute?text=[Command]> attribute to the method that must be executed when the command is invoked. This method will become the implementation of the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.Execute*?text=ICommand.Execute> interface method. It must have one of the following signatures, where `T` is an arbitrary type:

    ```csharp
    [Command]
    void Execute();

    [Command( Background = true )]
    void Execute(CancellationToken);  // Only for background commands. See below.

    [Command]
    void Execute(T);

    [Command( Background = true )]
    void Execute(T, CancellationToken);  // Only for background commands. See below.

    [Command]
    Task ExecuteAsync();

    [Command]
    Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken);

    [Command]
    Task ExecuteAsync(T);

    [Command]
    Task ExecuteAsync(T, CancellationToken);

    ```
3. Make the class `partial` to enable referencing the generated command properties from C# or WPF source code.

### Example: Simple commands

The following example implements a window with two commands: `Increment` and `Decrement`. As illustrated, the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute?text=[Command]> aspect generates two properties, `IncrementCommand` and `DecrementCommand`, assigned to an instance of the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.DelegateCommand> helper class. This class accepts a delegate to the `Increment` or `Decrement` method.

## Adding a CanExecute method or property

In addition to the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.Execute*> method, you can also supply an implementation of <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.CanExecute*?text=ICommand.CanExecute>. This implementation can be either a `bool` property or, when the `Execute` method has a parameter, a method that accepts the same parameter type and returns `bool`.

There are two ways to associate a `CanExecute` implementation with the `Execute` member:

* Implicitly, by respecting naming conventions. For a command named `Foo`, the `CanExecute` member can be named `CanFoo`, `CanExecuteFoo`, or `IsFooEnabled`. See below to learn how to customize these naming conventions.
* Explicitly, by setting the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute.CanExecuteMethod> or <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute.CanExecuteProperty> property of the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute>.

When the `CanExecute` member is a property and the declaring type implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> interface, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.CanExecuteChanged?text=ICommand.CanExecuteChanged> event will be raised whenever the `CanExecute` property changes. You can use the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Observability.ObservableAttribute?text=[Observable]> aspect to implement <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged>. See <xref:observability> for details.

### Example: Commands with a CanExecute property and _implicit_ association

The following example demonstrates two commands, `Increment` and `Decrement`, coupled to properties that determine if these commands are available: `CanIncrement` and `CanDecrement`.

[!metalama-test ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.Wpf/Commands/CanExecute.cs]

### Example: Commands with a CanExecute property and _explicit_ association

This example is identical to the one above, but it uses the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute.CanExecuteProperty> property to explicitly associate the `CanExecute` property with their `Execute` method.

[!metalama-test ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.Wpf/Commands/CanExecute_Explicit.cs]

### Example: Commands with a CanExecute property and [Observable]

The following example demonstrates the code generated when the `[Command]` and `[Observable]` aspects are used together. Notice the compactness of the source code and the significant size of the generated code.

[!metalama-test ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.Wpf/Commands/CanExecute_Observable.cs]

## Async commands

When the `Execute` method returns a `Task`, the `[Command]` aspect implements an asynchronous command, which means that the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.Execute*?text=ICommand.Execute> method returns immediately (i.e., after the first non-synchronous `await`). The aspect generates a property of type <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.AsyncDelegateCommand>, which implements <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> and exposes the following members:

- The <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.BaseAsyncDelegateCommand.ExecutionTask> property returns the task representing the last execution of the command.
- The <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.BaseAsyncDelegateCommand.Cancel*> method allows canceling the current task.
- The <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.AsyncDelegateCommand.CanExecute>, <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.BaseAsyncDelegateCommand.CanCancel>, <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.BaseAsyncDelegateCommand.IsCancellationRequested>, and <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.BaseAsyncDelegateCommand.IsRunning> properties expose the state of the command.

By default, the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.AsyncDelegateCommand.CanExecute> property returns `false` if the previous call of the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.AsyncDelegateCommand.Execute*> method is still running. To allow for concurrent execution, set the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute.SupportsConcurrentExecution?text=CommandAttribute.SupportsConcurrentExecution> property to `true`.

To track and cancel concurrent executions of the command, subscribe to the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.BaseAsyncDelegateCommand.Executed> event and use the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.DelegateCommandExecution> object.


## Background commands

By default, the implementation method of the command is executed in the foreground thread. You can dispatch its execution to a background thread by setting the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.CommandAttribute.Background?text=CommandAttribute.Background> property to `true`. This will work for implementation methods returning both `void` or a `Task`.

In both cases, the `[Command]` aspect generates a property of type <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.AsyncDelegateCommand>.


## Customizing naming conventions

All examples above relied on the default naming convention, which is based on the following assumptions:
* The command name is obtained by trimming the `Execute` method name (the one with the `[Command]` aspect) from:
    * prefixes: `_`, `m_`, and `Execute`,
    * suffix: `_`, `Command`, and `Async`.
* Given a command name `Foo` determined by the previous step:
    * The command property is named `FooCommand`.
    * The `CanExecute` command or method can be named `CanFoo`, `CanExecuteFoo`, or `IsFooEnabled`.

This naming convention can be modified by calling the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandExtensions.ConfigureCommand*> fabric extension method, then <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandOptionsBuilder.AddNamingConvention*?text=builder.AddNamingConvention>, and supply an instance of the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandNamingConvention> class.

If specified, the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandNamingConvention.CommandNamePattern?text=CommandNamingConvention.CommandNamePattern> is a regular expression that matches the command name from the name of the main method. If this property is unspecified, the default matching algorithm is used. The <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandNamingConvention.CanExecutePatterns> property is a list of patterns used to select the `CanExecute` property or method, and the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandNamingConvention.CommandPropertyName> property is a pattern that generates the name of the generated command property. In the <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandNamingConvention.CanExecutePatterns> and <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandNamingConvention.CommandPropertyName>, the `{CommandName}` substring is replaced by the name of the command returned by <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Wpf.Configuration.CommandNamingConvention.CommandNamePattern>.

Naming conventions are evaluated by priority order. The default priority is the order in which the convention has been added. It can be overwritten by supplying a value to the `priority` parameter.

The default naming convention is evaluated last and cannot be modified.

### Example: Czech Naming Conventions

The following example illustrates a naming convention for the Czech language. There are two conventions. The first matches the `Vykonat` prefix in the main method, for instance, it will match a method named `VykonatBlb` and return `Blb` as the command name. The second naming convention matches everything and removes the conventional prefixes `_` and `Execute` as described above. The default naming convention is never used in this example.
