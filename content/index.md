# Metalama Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of Metalama, a code quality and productivity improvement framework for C#.


## Documentation structure

| Book | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <xref:videos> | A collection of tutorial videos. |
| <xref:conceptual> | The exhaustive and precise reference documentation. |
| <xref:samples> | Several commented examples of with different steps of increasing complexity. |
| <xref:api> | The API documentation generated from the source code. |

## How to read this documentation?

There are typically two kinds of people using Metalama:

* if you plan to _use aspects written by others_, you start with <xref:using-metalama> and probably stop there.
* if you want to _create your own aspects_, start with  <xref:using-metalama> and then continue with <xref:simple-aspects>.

We assigned a _complexity level_ to each article, for instance, 100, 200, 300, as in the U.S. school system. Before you start an article of level 200, you should have a good understanding of level 100. We try not to add complex details to an article of a basic level. Sometimes, you will need to read several articles to read information about a given topic.
