# Metalama Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of Metalama, a framework designed to enhance code quality and productivity for C#.


## Documentation structure

| Book | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <xref:videos> | A collection of tutorial videos. |
| <xref:conceptual> | Comprehensive and precise reference documentation. |
| <xref:samples> | Commented examples with varying degrees of complexity. |
| <xref:api> | API documentation generated from the source code. |

## How to navigate this documentation?

There are typically two types of Metalama users:

* If you intend to _utilize aspects written by others_, begin with <xref:using-metalama> and likely conclude there.
* If you aspire to _develop your own aspects_, start with <xref:using-metalama> and proceed to <xref:simple-aspects>.

Each article is assigned a _complexity level_, such as 100, 200, 300, following the U.S. school system. Before advancing to a level 200 article, ensure you have a solid understanding of level 100. We strive to avoid incorporating complex details into basic level articles. Occasionally, you may need to peruse several articles to gather comprehensive information on a specific topic.
