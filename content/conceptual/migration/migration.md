# Migrating from PostSharp

You may want to migrate some or all of your projects from PostSharp to Metalama. If you decide to proceed, this chapter will assist you.

When we conceptualized Metalama as the successor to PostSharp, we elected to break backward compatibility. After all, the PostSharp Framework was designed during the years of C# 2.0 and .NET Framework 2.0 (2004-2010), and we have maintained backward compatibility since then. We could not leverage the new .NET stack (for instance, C# 11, .NET 6, and Roslyn) by adhering strictly to our 2010 API. Thus, we opted for a comprehensive redesign of the concepts and APIs.

However, we understand that many customers have codebases ranging from tens of thousands to millions of lines of code that utilize PostSharp. That's why we ensured that these customers wouldn't need to port these large codebases.

Consequently, we made the following decisions:

* You will need to completely rewrite your _aspects_.
* The _business code_ that merely _uses_ the aspects _should not typically require any changes_, except for find-and-replace-in-files operations and replacements of namespace imports.

We hope this is a satisfactory compromise.
