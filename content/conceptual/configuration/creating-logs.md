# Enabling logging

When reporting a Metalama bug, it is often helpful to attach Metalama log files. This document provides instructions on how to generate these logs.

## Step 1. Install the Metalama CLI tool

First, install the `metalama` .NET tool as outlined in <xref:dotnet-tool>.

## Step 2. Edit diagnostics.json

Run the following command:

```
metalama config edit diagnostics
```

This command will open a `diagnostics.json` file in your default editor. Make the following changes to this file:

1. In the `logging/processes` section, set the processes that should have logging enabled to `true`:
    * `Compiler`: This refers to the compile-time process.
    * `Rider`: This is the design-time Roslyn process of the Rider IDE.
    * `DevEnv`: This is the UI process of Visual Studio. Note that no aspect code runs in this process.
    * `RoslynCodeAnalysisService`: This is the design-time Roslyn process running under Visual Studio, where the aspect code runs.
2. In the `logging/trace` section, set the categories that should have logging enabled to `true`. To enable logging for all categories, set the `*` category to `true`.

The following example shows how to enable logging for the compiler process for all categories.

```json
{
    "logging": {
        "processes": {
                "Other": false,
                "Compiler": true,
                "DevEnv": false,
                "RoslynCodeAnalysisService": false,
                "Rider": false,
                "BackstageWorker": false,
                "MetalamaConfig": false,
                "TestHost": false
      },
    "trace": {
        "*": false
      },
    "stopLoggingAfterHours": 5.0
  }
}
```

To validate the correctness of the JSON file, run the following command:

```powershell
metalama config validate diagnostics
```

## Step 3. Restart processes

Diagnostic settings are cached in all processes, including background compiler processes and IDE helper processes.

To restart background compiler processes, run the following command:

```powershell
metalama kill
```

If you need to alter the logging configuration of the IDE processes, you will need to manually restart your IDE.

## Step 4. Execute Metalama

Perform the sequence of actions that you wish to log.

> [!WARNING]
> Logging is automatically disabled after a certain number of hours following the last modification of `diagnostics.json`. The duration is specified in the `stopLoggingAfterHours` property in the `logging` section and defaults to 2 hours. To change this duration, you can edit the `diagnostics.json` file.

## Step 5. Open the log file

You can find the log in the `%TEMP%\Metalama\Logs` directory.
