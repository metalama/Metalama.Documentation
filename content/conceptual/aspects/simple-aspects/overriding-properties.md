# Getting started: overriding fields and properties

In <xref:simple-override-method>, you learned how to change the implementation of a method with an aspect. You can apply the same technique to fields and properties by extending <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideFieldOrPropertyAspect>.

## Overriding a field or property

Follow these steps to create an aspect capable of overriding a field or property:

1. Add the `Metalama.Framework` package to your project.

2. Create a new class derived from the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideFieldOrPropertyAspect> abstract class. This class will serve as a custom attribute, so it's recommended to name it with the `Attribute` suffix.

3. Implement the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideFieldOrPropertyAspect.OverrideProperty> property in plain C#. To call the original implementation, use <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.meta.Proceed?text=meta.Proceed>.

4. Since the aspect is a custom attribute, you can transform a field or property by simply adding the aspect custom attribute to the field or property.

> [!WARNING]
> When applying an aspect to a field, Metalama will automatically transform the field into a property. If the field is used by reference using `ref`, `out`, and `in` keywords, it will result in a compile-time error.

### Trick: an empty OverrideFieldOrPropertyAspect aspect

The following example demonstrates an empty implementation of <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideFieldOrPropertyAspect> applied to a property and a field.

[!metalama-test ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.AspectFramework/EmptyOverrideFieldOrProperty.cs name="Empty OverrideFieldOrProperty"]

This aspect doesn't perform any specific function, but as you can see, it transforms the field into a property.

## Getting or setting the underlying property

If you've only worked with methods so far, you're likely familiar with using the `meta.Proceed()` method in your template. This method also works in a property template: when called from the getter, it returns the field or property value; when called from the setter, it sets the field or property to the value of the `value` parameter.

If you need to get the property value from the setter, or if you need to set the property value to something other than the `value` parameter, you can do so by getting or setting the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.IExpression.Value?text=meta.Target.FieldOrProperty.Value> property.

### Example: trimming strings

In this aspect, you will see how you can trim whitespace before and after string values before they are assigned to the field or property.

[!metalama-test ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.EnhanceProperties/Trimmed.cs name="Trimming string fields and properties"]

The aspect doesn't need to modify the getter, so it only calls `meta.Proceed()`, and Metalama replaces this call with the original implementation of the property. We could have written `get => meta.Target.PropertyOrField.Value` instead, achieving the same effect.

The setter is modified to call the `Trim` method on the input `value`. The most concise and simple code is `set => meta.Target.PropertyOrField.Value = value?.Trim`. Alternatively, we could have written the following code:

```cs
set
{
    value = value?.Trim();
    meta.Proceed();
}
```

### Example: turning the value to upper case

The following example is similar to the previous one, but instead of trimming a string, we normalize it to upper case.

We apply the aspect to a class representing a shipment between two airports.

[!metalama-test ~/code/Metalama.Documentation.SampleCode.EnhanceProperties/UpperCase.cs name="Changing case to Upper case"]

Note that in this example, `From` is a public field and `To` is a public property. They are deliberately kept that way to demonstrate that the aspect works on both because <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.IFieldOrProperty> is used in the aspect. If you want the aspect to apply only to properties and not to fields, you should use <xref:Metalama.Framework.Code.IProperty>.

## Going deeper

If you want to go deeper into field/property overrides, consider exploring the following articles:

* In this article, you learned how to use `meta.Proceed` and `meta.Target.Method.Name` in your templates. You can write much more complex and powerful templates, even performing compile-time `if` and `foreach` blocks. To see how, you can jump directly to <xref:templates>.

* To learn how to override several fields and properties from a single type-level aspect, jump to <xref:overriding-methods>.
