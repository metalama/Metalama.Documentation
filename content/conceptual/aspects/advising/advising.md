# Transforming code

In <xref:simple-aspects>, you have learned how to build simple aspects composed of a single transformation (or advice). In this section, you will learn more advanced scenarios, and you will also see how to create aspects composed of multiple pieces of advice. But before we start, we must introduce a few more concepts.


| Article | Description |
|----|----|
| <xref:advising-concepts> | This article describes important concepts. We suggest reading this article first, then jumping to the article that covers the advice you need. |
| <xref:overriding-methods> | This article shows advanced techniques to override methods. It is the continuation of <xref:simple-override-method>. |
| <xref:overriding-fields-or-properties> | This article shows advanced techniques to override fields and properties. It is the continuation of <xref:simple-override-property>. |
| <xref:overriding-events> | This article shows how to override events. |
| <xref:contracts> | This article shows advanced techniques to validate the value of fields, properties, or parameters using contracts. It is the continuation of <xref:simple-contracts>. |
| <xref:introducing-members> | This article explains how to add new members to an existing type using aspects. |
| <xref:implementing-interfaces> | This article explains how to make an existing type implement a new interface using aspects. |
| <xref:initializers> | This article explains how to add initialization logic to constructors. |
| <xref:adding-attributes> | This article explains how to add or remove custom attributes. |
| <xref:introducing-constructor-parameters> | This article explains how to append new parameters to constructors, and pull their value from constructors of derived classes.
| <xref:sharing-state-with-advice> | This article discusses how the `BuildAspect` method can pass parameters or state to the templates.
