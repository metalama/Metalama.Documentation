# Marking experimental APIs

The [[Obsolete]](xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute) attribute is a familiar custom attribute that generates a warning when the marked declaration is used, unless the referencing declaration is also marked as `[Obsolete]`.

There may be situations where a warning for an experimental API that may be changed or removed later is necessary. The `[Obsolete]` attribute may not be the best choice for this, as the error message it generates could mislead users. As an alternative, Metalama provides the <xref:Metalama.Extensions.Architecture.Aspects.ExperimentalAttribute> attribute and the <xref:Metalama.Extensions.Architecture.ArchitectureExtensions.Experimental*> compile-time method, which are better suited for this purpose.

## Marking a specific API as experimental

To generate warnings when an experimental API is being used, it is best to use the <xref:Metalama.Extensions.Architecture.Aspects.ExperimentalAttribute> attribute. Follow these steps:

1. Add the `Metalama.Extensions.Architecture` package to your project.

2. Annotate the API with the <xref:Metalama.Extensions.Architecture.Aspects.ExperimentalAttribute>.

### Example: Using the Experimental attribute

In the following example, the `ExperimentalApi` class is explicitly marked as experimental.

## Programmatically marking APIs as experimental

If you wish to mark several APIs as experimental using a programmatic rule instead of hand-picking declarations, you can use fabrics. Follow these steps:

1. Add the `Metalama.Extensions.Architecture` package to your project.

2. Create or reuse a fabric type as described in <xref:fabrics>.

3. Import the <xref:Metalama.Extensions.Architecture.Fabrics> namespace to benefit from extension methods.

4. Edit the  <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.ProjectFabric.AmendProject*>,  <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.NamespaceFabric.AmendNamespace*> or  <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.TypeFabric.AmendType*> of this method. 

5. Select the experimental APIs using the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.IAspectReceiver`1.Select*>, <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.IAspectReceiver`1.SelectMany*>  and <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.IAspectReceiver`1.Where*> methods.

6. Call the <xref:Metalama.Extensions.Architecture.ArchitectureExtensions.Experimental*> method.

### Example: Using the Experimental compile-time method

In the following example, all public members of `ExperimentalNamespace` are programmatically marked as experimental.
