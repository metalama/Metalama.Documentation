# Metalama Diff

Aspects transform your code. The differences between your original source code and the transformed version can be observed using the Metalama Diff option. This option is available from the context menu in Visual Studio.

To view the diff version, right-click on the code. This action will bring up a menu as shown below:

Upon clicking, the differences between the source code and the transformed code will be displayed side by side, as depicted in the following image:

The screenshot illustrates the source code of `FlakyMethod` alongside the code after it has been transformed by the `[Log]` aspect. Note that the command displays the entire file in both its original and transformed versions side by side.

To view changes for a specific section of the code, select that portion from the dropdown menu as shown below:
