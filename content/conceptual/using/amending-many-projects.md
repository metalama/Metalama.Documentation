# Adding aspects to multiple projects

If you manage a repository or a solution composed of multiple projects, you may find it beneficial to add aspects from a central location. This article outlines several methods to achieve this.

These approaches are also applicable when configuring aspect libraries or adding architectural rules.

## Using transitive project fabrics

_Transitive project fabrics_ are executed in any project that _references_ the assembly containing the fabric, either as a project or package reference.

### Execution order of transitive fabrics

Transitive project fabrics are executed after any _project fabric_ in the current project.

If multiple transitive project fabrics are active, they are executed in the following order:

1. Depth in the dependency graph: dependencies with lower depth (i.e., "closer" to the main project) are processed first.
2. Assembly name (in alphabetical order).

Transitive dependencies are intentionally executed after compilation dependencies, allowing the latter to configure transitive dependencies before they run.

### Example

Consider the following dependency graph:

```mermaid
flowchart BT
    subgraph MySolution.Core
        CoreTransitiveFabric
        CoreClasses[Other types]
    end
    subgraph MySolution.Library1
        Library1Classes[Other types]
    end
    MySolution.Library1 --> MySolution.Core
    subgraph MySolution.Library2
        Library2TransitiveFabric
        Library2Classes[Other types]
    end
    MySolution.Library2 --> MySolution.Core
    subgraph MySolution.App
       AppClasses[Other types]
    end
    MySolution.App --> MySolution.Library1
    MySolution.App --> MySolution.Library2
```

In `MySolution`, the following transitive project fabrics will be active:

| Project | Active transitive project fabrics |
|--|--|
| `MySolution.Core` | None |
| `MySolution.Library1` | `CoreTransitiveFabric` |
| `MySolution.Library2` | `CoreTransitiveFabric` |
| `MySolution.App` | First `CoreTransitiveFabric`, then `Library2TransitiveFabric` |


## Using common project fabrics

Another approach is to rely on the directory structure instead of the dependency graph.

The concept is to write a project fabric, store it in the root directory of the repository, and automatically include this file in each project using [Directory.Build.props](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build).

#### Step 1. Create a project fabric

In the parent directory that recursively contains all projects you want to be affected by the shared fabric, create a project fabric derived from <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.ProjectFabric> as you would do for a regular project fabric.

#### Step 2. Create Directory.Build.props

In the same directory, create a file named `Directory.Build.props` with the following content:

```xml
<Project>
	<!-- Imports Directory.Build.props of the upper directory. -->
	<Import Project="$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove('Directory.Build.props', '$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)../'))"
			Condition="Exists('$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove(`Directory.Build.props`, `$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)../`))')"/>

	<!-- Include the shared fabric -->
	<ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)SharedFabric.cs" />
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

#### Example

See <xref:sample-shared-fabric>.

### Execution order of shared fabrics

When you have multiple project fabrics in the same project, they are ordered by the following criteria:

1. Distance of the source file from the root directory: fabrics closer to the root directory are processed first.
2. Fabric namespace.
3. Fabric type name.

### Example

Suppose we have the following project structure:

```text

repo
+--- dir1
|     +-- subdir11
|     |   +-- Project11.csproj
|     |   +-- Project11Fabric.cs
|     +-- subdir12
|         + Project12.csproj
+--- dir2
|    +-- subdir21
|    |    +-- Project21.csproj
|    +-- subdir22
|        +-- Project22.csproj
|        +-- Project21Fabric.cs
+-- SharedFabric.cs
+-- Directory.Build.props
```

Then the projects have the following fabrics:


| Project | Active transitive project fabrics |
|--|--|
| `Project11` | `SharedFabric`, `Project11Fabric` |
| `Project12` | `SharedFabric` |
| `Project21` | `SharedFabric` |
| `Project12` | `SharedFabric`, `Project21Fabric` |
