# Using Metalama

If you are looking to understand how to _use_ aspects without the necessity to _create_ new ones, this chapter is designed for you. You may cease reading after this chapter. However, if your goal is to create aspects, starting with this chapter is still beneficial as it introduces the core principles and techniques.

Upon completion of this guide, you should feel comfortable using aspects in your codebase.

## Who should read this chapter?

Consider reading this chapter if:

* You have recently joined a team that is already utilizing Metalama.
* You plan to use ready-made aspects but do not intend to construct your own.
* You aim to create your own aspects in the future, but prefer not to rush into it.

|<xref:understanding-your-code-with-aspects>| This article elucidates how to utilize Code Lens and Code Diff to comprehend your code. |
|<xref:debugging-aspect-oriented-code> | This article provides insight into how to debug transformed code as you would traditionally do with Visual Studio. |
|<xref:applying-live-templates> | Live templates are unique types of aspects that directly modify your source code in the editor. This article guides you on how to use them. |
|<xref:fabrics-adding-aspects>| Manually adding aspects or using the refactoring menu is not always feasible or practical.
