# Installing Visual Studio Tools for Metalama and PostSharp

The [Visual Studio Tools for Metalama and PostSharp](https://www.postsharp.net/links/download-unified-vsx) is an extension that enhances your development experience by providing features such as:

* CodeLens additions for quickly viewing the impact of aspects on your code,
* Aspect Explorer for displaying which aspects are available in the current solution and which code is affected,

* Syntax highlighting for aspect code.

While this extension is optional, it is highly recommended for a more comprehensive understanding of your aspect-oriented code.
