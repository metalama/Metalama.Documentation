# Enabling logging

If you report a Metalama bug, you may be asked to send Metalama logs. Here is how to produce them.


## Step 1. Install metalama-config

Install `metalama-config` as described in <xref:dotnet-tool>.

## Step 2. Edit diagnostics.json

Execute the command:

```
metalama-config diag edit
```

This should open a `diagnostics.json` file in your default editor. Edit this file as follows:

1. In the `logging/processes` section, set to `true` the processes for which logging should be enabled:
    * `Compiler`: the compile-time process.
    * `Rider`: the design-time Roslyn process running under Rider.
    * `DevEnv`: the UI process of Visual Studio (note that there is no aspect code running in this process).
    * `RoslynCodeAnalysisService`: the design-time Roslyn process running under Visual Studio (this is where the aspect code runs).
2. In the `logging/categories` section, set to `true` the categories for which logging should be enabled. To enable logging for everything, enable the `*` category.

In the next example, logging is enabled for the compiler process and for all categories.


```json
{
    "logging": {
        "processes": {
            "Compiler": true,
            "Rider": false,
            "DevEnv": false,
            "RoslynCodeAnalysisService": false
        },
        "categories": {
            "*": true
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3. Execute Metalama

Restart the logged processes:

 * If you are logging the `Compiler` process, restart the Roslyn compiler processes.
 * If you are logging any design-time process, restart the IDE.

Execute the sequence of actions to be logged.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not forget to turn off logging after you are done.

## Step 4. Open the log file

You will find the log under the `%TEMP%\Metalama\Logs` directory.
