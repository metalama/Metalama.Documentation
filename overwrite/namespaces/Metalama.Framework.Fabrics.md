summary: *content

This namespace enables the addition of fabrics to your code. Similar to aspects, fabrics are executed at compile time. However, unlike aspects, fabrics do not require a custom attribute for integration into your code. The mere existence of the fabric in your code applies it to your code.

There are four types of fabrics, each applying to a different scope. All types of fabrics can add aspects and validators within their respective scopes. Type fabrics have the additional capability of adding advice to their scope, and project fabrics can set configuration options.

| Kind | Base Class | Scope | Abilities |
|-------|-|---------|--|
| Type Fabrics | <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.TypeFabric> | The containing type (type fabrics are nested types) and any member. | Add aspects, advice, and validators.
| Namespace Fabrics | <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.NamespaceFabric> | Any type in the namespace that contains the fabric type. | Add aspects and validators.
| Project Fabrics | <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.ProjectFabric> | Any type in the project that contains the fabric type or in any project. | Add aspects and validators, and set configuration options. Project fabrics can be inherited from parent directories.
| Transitive Project Fabrics | <xref:Metalama.Framework.Fabrics.TransitiveProjectFabric> | Any type in any project _referencing_ the containing project. | Add aspects and validators, and set configuration options.

> [!NOTE]
> For enhanced design-time performance and usability, it is strongly recommended to implement type fabrics in a separate file and mark the parent class as `partial`.
